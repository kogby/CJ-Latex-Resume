## CJ LaTeX Resume

Hi there

This repository serves as both a **resume template** and **workshop material** for students who want to learn how to use LaTeX effectively, especially beginners or those looking for templates. This workshop covers the basics of formatting, layouts, formulas, lists, tables, citations, and more.

This template is used as teaching material for the LaTeX Workshop held at NTU, which had more than 140 students enrolled.

## Templates

This repository contains LaTeX templates for resumes and slides, customized to meet specific needs while remaining adaptable and easy to modify.

### Template Features

- **Simple:** Easily modify and rearrange content to suit your specific needs.
- **Clean:** A minimalist layout for enhanced readability and professional presentation.
- **Comprehensive:** General-purpose design without overcomplicating the details.
