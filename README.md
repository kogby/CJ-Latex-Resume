# LaTeX Workshop

Hi there

This repository serves as a resource for students at NTU who want to learn how to use LaTeX effectively, especially beginners or those looking for templates. This workshop covers the basics of formatting, layouts, formulas, lists, tables, citations, and more.

## Templates

This repository contains LaTeX templates for slides and resumes. These templates have been curated and modified to provide simplicity, flexibility, and completeness. They are designed to be easily refactored, customized, and adapted for various use cases.

#### The template has following Features which I believe is important when making one.

- **Simple :** Modify and rearrange content to suit your needs with ease.
- **Clean :** Clean layouts for readability and professional presentation.
- **Comprehensive :** General without too much detail.
